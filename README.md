# Flip text

Uses Unicode to make text look like it's been rotated 180 degrees.

## Acknowledgments

I got the idea to do this years ago from a LiveJournal entry. Per request,
I'm making this vaguer, but I owe a big thanks to the author for the fun
idea (and the most interesting mappings) as well as for their patience for
the noise and chaos I sent their way.

Thank you also to Brook Monroe, Tim McCormack, Glards, and Yeeliberto amongst
others for further suggestions.
