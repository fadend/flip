# Flip text

Uses Unicode to make text look like it's been rotated 180 degrees.

## Acknowledgments

I got the idea to do this from pne. (See http://pne.livejournal.com/398399.html,
but don't comment on it! In retrospect, it may have been a mistake to link to that
since a lot of people bugged him with complaints that should have gone to me. Sorry.)

Thank you to Brook Monroe, Tim McCormack, Glards, and Yeeliberto amongst
others for further suggestions.
